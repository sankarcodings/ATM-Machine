Project Title: ATM Machine Simulator

Description:

This project simulates a basic ATM machine using Core Java, GUI Swing for the user interface, JDBC for database connectivity, and SQL for data storage and retrieval.

Features:

- User authentication and authorization
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- Balance inquiry
- Transaction history

Technologies Used:

- Core Java: for the business logic and backend functionality
- GUI Swing: for creating the user interface and interactive elements
- JDBC: for connecting to the database and executing SQL queries
- SQL: for storing and retrieving user data and transaction history

Database Schema:

- Users table: stores user information (username, password, account number, balance)
- Transactions table: stores transaction history (account number, transaction type, amount, date)

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a database with the provided SQL script (db.sql)
3. Update the database credentials in the JDBC connection string (DBConnection.java)
4. Run the Main.java file to launch the ATM simulator
